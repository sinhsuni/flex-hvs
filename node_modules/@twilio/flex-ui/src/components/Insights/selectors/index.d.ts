 *
 * Use this only in a mapStateToProps FACTORY. Due to the fact how we reimplemented connect,
 * the shape of the store is different when using factory and when returning object immediately.
 * The solution would be to use selectors to access appState instead of wrapping connect,
 * but its too late for that, since this is already exposed to customers.
 *
 * The use of the factory is absolutely vital here, because without it reselect doesn't properly
 * cache the results and only the last call is cached. When multiple instances of connected component exist,
 * they each have different ownProps and selector is called again, making memoization useless.
 *
 * Without the factory, the selectors are recalculated EVERY TIME ANY REDUX ACTION IS DISPATCHED.
