The `start` scripts sets up the server locally so you develop your Flex plugin in real-time.

Usage:
    `npm run start`

#### Changing server port

By the default, the script will try to start a server on port 3000, or the first available port larger than 3000. You can provide a custom port using the `PORT` environmental variable:

```bash
PORT=4000 npm run start
```
